# Module 19 : PWA Coding Walkthrough

## Progressive Web Application coding practice

- How to use a `manifest.json` in our projects, and how that will work along with a service worker to make our app a `PWA`.
- How to link a manifest to the HTML to let the browser know the app is a `PWA`.
- How to use `webpack` to dynamically create a `manifest.json` based on configurations provided in `webpack.config.js`.
- How to add properties to the `manifest.json` so the user can add the `PWA` to the home screen of their mobile device.

- Measured performance metrics for a website using `Chrome DevTool's Lighthouse` app.

- Performed `Lighthouse audits` to expose performance flaws which are especially critical when dealing with slower mobile devices on sluggish networks.

- Learned how to use an automated build tool like `webpack` to `bundle` assets through a dependency graph to optimize performance by `lazy loading` and `minification`.

- Used `service workers` to `cache` the websites assets for offline functionality.

- Offered installable icons for quick access to our app using `PWAs`.
